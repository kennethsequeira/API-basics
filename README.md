# API Basics

### Who is this for?

This guide is meant for absolute beginners. The end goal is for you to learn about the very basics of working with APIs, specifically REST API, and make a few API calls using a tool such as Postman or from your terminal. 

### What is an API?

To start making API calls, we first start with learning about an API. 

API stands for Application Programmable Interface. In simple terms, it is a way for two different (or multiple) computer programs or software to communicate with each other. 

Let's understand with an example. Say, you have two different programs, one is a CRM which hosts all your customer interactions and data, and the other is an accounting system. Both are different SaaS programs. 

Now, whenever a new customer is acquired, you already have some data residing in the CRM. At this point, you'd need to share the data into your accounting software for billing and payment processing. What would you do? The easiest option would be to simply copy over the data every time you acquire a new customer. 

But what if you are maybe acquiring 50 customers per day? You'd say okay, creating the record manually would be a pain, and you'd say maybe you can export the data from the CRM in a spreadsheet (Excel, CSV) and upload it back into the Accounting software. Great! But now you have the overhead of matching the columns correctly, also you'd do this maybe once or twice a day at best.

If we now increase the scope to acquiring a few hundred customers a day, even the spreadsheet method becomes tasking. This is where APIs will come in handy. 

The Accounting application will have a set of APIs that the CRM can use to share the customer data. This will remove the manual intervention discussed in the first couple of data sharing options. And since this is a more automated way, it can run on a far better scale than copying data one by one, or uploading a part of it at a time using spreadsheets!

Now, that we have a basic understanding of what an API is and can do, let's get to know different kinds of data available. 

**NOTE:** In this document, I'll be focusing on REST APIs and referring to web applications.
